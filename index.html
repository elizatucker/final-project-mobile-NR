            <p>Stepping into the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District, one can not help
                    but notice the murals lining the streets. Some sun-faded and battered by years 
                    of weather, others still vibrant and exploding with colors, the murals extend 
                    above storefronts, down alleys and across the garage doors of homes. What they 
                    all have in common are the stories they tell of culture, pain and resistance 
                    in the local community.

            <p>Public-facing arts — murals, mosaics and other works on the streets and buildings 
                of San Francisco — have long served as a canvas for political expression, beginning 
                in the 1970s with immigrant communities protesting U.S. involvement in Central 
                America by painting community murals in the Mission District. Today, public-facing 
                arts continue to address injustice, with many artists calling attention to the 
                genocide in Gaza. From the Mission District’s earliest murals to today’s urgent 
                cries for justice, public-facing art is a compelling tool used to fight back 
                against injustice.

            <h4>THE MISSION'S LEGACY</h4>
            <p>One of the hallmark institutions of public-facing arts of San Francisco is 
                Precita Eyes Muralists, a community-based, inner-city mural arts organization 
                dedicated to mural creation, preservation and education. Founded in 1977, 
                Precita Eyes offers walking tours through some of the most famous murals in 
                the Mission.
            </p>
            <p>The murals of the Mission have a rich history dating back to the 1970s, when 
                the first pieces began popping up in Balmy Alley – regarded by long-time 
                muralist and Precita Eyes tour guide Patricia Rose as the original mural alley. 
                Many of the earliest murals addressed political strife in Central America, as 
                civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua prompted mass immigration 
                to San Francisco. Each minute detail of the murals in Balmy Alley serves as a 
                reminder of a collective history of repression and retaliation that refuses 
                to be forgotten.

                  <p>“I’ve been doing this for, I don’t know, 50 years or more. And, unfortunately, 
                    these issues don’t seem to go away,” said Juana Alicia, a long-time artist and 
                    activist within the Chicano Art Movement. Her most famous pieces include: "Las 
                    Lechugueras," "La Llorona’s Sacred Waters," "Ceasefire/Alto Al Fuego" and "MAESTRAPEACE."

                  <p>Alicia, whose murals can be seen in California, Pennsylvania, Nicaragua and Mexico 
                    – where she is now located – often draws inspiration from current events. By working 
                    through intersectional lenses such as decolonization, feminism and indigenous identity, 
                    Alicia sees her art as a way to confront issues within the communities that surround her.

                <div class="step" data-step="">

                    the way that I can deal with the political repression that we’ve suffered throughout 
                    the history of the United States – against women, against people of color, against 
                    immigrants, against non-binary people, against gay people, against disabled people.”

             <cite>Dottie Lux with SF Artists for Palestine on March 4, 2025 (@sf.artists.for.palestine).</cite>
    </div>
    <div class="gaza-text">
        <p>Public-facing arts continue to act as powerful tools of protest, with shifting – 
            yet urgent – themes. Recently, San Francisco housed a new wave of art that 
            challenges the ongoing genocide in Gaza. 
        </p>
        <p>Artists like Dottie Lux have turned to using their art as a means of expressing 
            the pain and outrage felt by Palestinians. Through her platform, Lux challenges 
            the status quo, even if it means stepping away from the commercial success more 
            palatable art may bring.
        </p>
        <p>“For me, it really boils down to two things: whether you want to be willing to 
            use your art to say something, or if you’re fully relying on your art to make 
            money,” said Lux, who recently curated a multi-sensory exhibit transforming art 
            into essential funds for families in Gaza. “I have been a performance artist for 
            over 20 years, and for most of my career, I’ve used my voice to be cheeky or funny 
            or appealing – very commercial. But since October of 2023, I didn’t really feel 
            like I had that luxury anymore.” 
        </p>
        <p>In 2024, Lux spent three months in the West Bank, serving as protective presence 
            for Palestinian families with the International Solidarity Movement. Her time 
            there greatly influenced the exhibit, which featured photography, paintings and 
            a soundscape enshrouding visitors within the experience of a demolition by Israeli 
            soldiers. And yet, Lux said there is still more work to be done.
        </p>
        <p>“We are doing the very most that we possibly can, and it is still the least that 
            we can do,” said Lux.
        </p>
        <p>Another artist, Palestinian-American Chris Gazaleh, has been creating art that raises 
            awareness about the history, people and struggle for freedom in Palestine for years, 
            with his passion for muralism stemming from his time spent in the Mission growing up. 
            His practice has earned him a wall in Clarion Alley, which has been his practice 
            since 2012.
        </p>
        <p>“The thing that really inspired me a lot to make my art public was the fact that we 
            need a voice. We need to find platforms that are not controlled by mainstream corporate 
            media. For me to be able to actually educate people on something they would never hear 
            on the mainstream news, it’s a privilege,” Gazaleh said.
        </p>
        <p>Gazaleh further achieved this goal in early 2025, when he curated From the River 
            to the Bay, a multidisciplinary exhibition housed at SOMArts. The exhibit featured 
            the work of 11 artists showing solidarity for Palestine’s struggle, whom Gazaleh 
            helped platform. 
        </p>
        <p>“It was a good opportunity to support other Palestinian artists or other non-Palestinian 
            artists who are inspirations to me, and it was nice to be able to put people on,” he said.

<!--SANITIZED EXPRESSION-->
<div class="sanitized-section">
    <div class="sanitized-text">
        <h4>SANITIZED EXPRESSION</h4>
        <p>San Francisco, a city known for its convergence of outspoken political activism 
            and vibrant arts, continues to push the boundaries of the conventional through 
            its public-facing arts. Yet, the tension between artistic expression and political 
            protest remains a thin line.
            </p>
            <p> While the murals of the Mission District are public-facing, those with political 
            motivations are privately owned. As per the San Francisco Arts Commission, publicly
            -funded art, which is often publicly available, cannot be political. 
            </p>
            <p>“San Francisco is not tearing down anti-Zionist work or anything like that, but 
            they’re going in the back door…to promote art that is more digestible,” Lux said.
            </p>
            <p>Privately-owned but public-facing art is not free from sterilization, either. 
                Gazaleh noted that his murals have been defaced by people upset with his art 
                since he began his practice in earnest 13 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>“A lot of people really respect and love my art, and just appreciate the fact 
                that it's out there and it exists. And then, of course, there's that small 
                population of people who are against my work,” Gazaleh said. “They're there. 
                They exist, but I don't let them intimidate me or stop me from doing what I do.”
            </p>
            <p>Gazaleh does not allow naysayers to interrupt his mission, though, and he often 
                repaints defaced murals. “I want to hopefully, inspire people from all walks of 
                life to continue a message in the energy of resistance, like through art, through 
                music, through whatever form it may take,” he said.
            </p>
    </div>
</div>
    
<!--HANDS OF RESISTANCE-->
<div class="resistance-section">
    <div class="resistance-text">
        <h4>HANDS OF RESISTANCE</h4>
        <p>Despite these challenges, the power of public-facing art to express a range of 
        sentiments, from dissent to appreciation, is undeniable. In the Mission, where murals 
        have long served as an outlet for expression, art still speaks loudly–about hope, 
        about history and about change. One such mural in the Mission depicts two hands 
        coming together – an image of unity and strength.
        </p>
        <p>"Tribute to Archbishop Oscar Romero" honors the teachings and legacy of the fourth 
        archbishop of El Salvador who was assassinated in 1980. According to Rose, the 
        memorial urges people to follow his teachings, which would be to get to work to 
        make change.
        </p>
        <p>“The biggest element in the mural is the two hands because those are the tools 
        we all get to get started with,” Rose said. “We get one on the end of each arm, 
        but to really change the world, everybody has to work toward it, so we have a 
        group of people in the center to remind us of that.”
        </p>
        <p>The mural’s message is clear: our work is far from finished, and the fight for 
        justice is ours to tackle through community. Public-facing art remains a crucial 
        element of that fight, unflinching in its call for change and permanently enshrined 
        along the walls of San Francisco.
